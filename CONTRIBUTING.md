## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ 
- npm 8+
- FalkorDB instance for testing
- Git

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/falkordb-mcpserver.git
   cd falkordb-mcpserver
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your FalkorDB and Redis connection details
   ```

4. **Run tests to ensure everything works:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Test your changes:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   ```

### Code Standards

- **TypeScript**: All code must be written in TypeScript with proper types
- **ESLint**: Code must pass linting (`npm run lint`)
- **Tests**: New features must include tests
- **Documentation**: Update README.md if you add new features

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

Examples:
feat(tools): add new graph visualization tool
fix(service): resolve connection timeout issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Tests should be placed alongside source files with `.test.ts` extension
- Use Jest for testing framework
- Mock external dependencies (FalkorDB, Redis)
- Aim for high test coverage

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('Feature Name', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  it('should do something specific', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```
